# hello-world
just getting started, learning as I go
got a BS in computer science a few years ago, but have no friends who like this
kind of stuff.  would like to code for a living.  completed a data science data
boot-camp, leaning towards that now.

Been away for a while, completed several boot-camps in python, data science,
SQL, web scaping, C++, etc.  Will get around to improving this project while I
pursue others.  Looking to contribute to open source and volunteer to gain
experience.
